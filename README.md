# Goal to Data Science Mastery

## 1. Learn how to operate pandas and numpys, while also learning techniques for preprocessing datasets

I have learned thus far how to pull in datasets as DataFrames, and the ability to visualize the data in the generic Jupyter Notebook environment. 

I have used these general functions below to achieve preprocessing: 

1. df.head() - to see the first 5 rows of the dataset
2. df.tail() - to see the last 5 rows of the dataset
3. df.info() - to see the data types of each column
4. df.describe() - to see the statistical summary of the dataset
5. df.isnull().sum() - to see the number of null values in each column
6. df.dropna() - to drop all null values in the dataset
7. df.fillna() - to fill all null values in the dataset
8. df.drop() - to drop a column in the dataset
9. df.rename() - to rename a column in the dataset
10. df.astype() - to change the data type of a column in the dataset
11. df.duplicated() - to see if there are any duplicated rows in the dataset
12. df.drop_duplicates() - to drop all duplicated rows in the dataset
13. df.corr() - to see the correlation between columns in the dataset

I have also learned how to use the following functions to manipulate the data in the dataset:

1. StandardScaler() - to scale the data in the dataset between certain values
2. MinMaxScaler() - to scale the data in the dataset between 0 and 1
3. LabelEncoder() - to encode the data in the dataset into numerical values
4. OneHotEncoder() - to encode the data in the dataset into binary values
5. train_test_split() - to split the dataset into training and testing sets
6. cross_val_score() - to cross validate the data in the dataset
7. GridSearchCV() - to find the best parameters for the data in the dataset
8. confusion_matrix() - to see the confusion matrix of the data in the dataset

## 2. Learn how to visualize the entire dataset, using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn modules. 

## 3. Learn how to use machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of the dataset.

## 4. Learn how to use deep learning algorithms to predict the outcome of the dataset.

## 5. Learn how to use natural language processing to predict the outcome of the dataset.
